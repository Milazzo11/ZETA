NOTE: THIS IS A TEMPORARY REPOSITORY

ONCE COMPLETE, THE NEW VERSION OF THE "Yellowtail Zero-storage Encrypted Ticket Authentication (YT-ZETA)" WILL BE FOUND AT: Milazzo11/Yellowtail
(if anybody besides me actually looks at the projects I make lol)

prob just change the name to ZETA

-- ID store replay attack prevention can be modified to use shared state KV store
-- SQLite DB code can be replaced with an alternative like Postgres
this will allow replicas and better concurrency/load balancing
HOWEVER, this version does not ship with these changes,
as I prioritize plug-and-play functionality
